Flash Cards to help my child learn sight words and it is timed to monitor progress

01-24-2018 10:38pm - Not sure how GitHub works but just wanted to let you know what is going on.  

I am working on a app to help my child with their sight words.  I am a very new developer, (a few weeks in) and decided to build an application to help me learn.  This project is HTML, CSS and JS.

My break file is the file I used to play around with the sample code I downloanded.  Hence the name break.  I am trying to get a timer to start, in the background, and once the last flashcard has been displayed, it will display the time.  After reviewing some code and seeing how they worked I said i was just going to break my code and copy and paste stuff in. It worked!  Mostly.  The timer is off and next I am looking to find out why.

I am just putting this here for now and will ask for advise in the morning about my code.
